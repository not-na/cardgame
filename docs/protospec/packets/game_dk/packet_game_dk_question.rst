Purpose
-------

Using this packet, the server signalises a client, that it is its time to make a certain
move. A question packet will be answered by the client with an :cg:packet:`cg:game.dk.announce`
packet. This packet is only available for the game :term:`Doppelkopf`\ .

It will be used asking for a *Vorbehalt* at the begin of each round. In the course of this,
the concerned players will be inquired after *soli*\ , *Schmei√üen*\ , *Armut* and *Hochzeit*\ .
In the cases of a *Hochzeit* or an *Armut*\ , the choice of the trick or of the cards to
exchange are requested by this packet. It will also be used to inquire after *Schweinchen*\ ,
*Superschweine* and *Hyperschweine*.

.. seealso::
   See :doc:`../../doppelkopf/rules` for further information on special rules.

In case of an accusation concerning an external misconduct, e.g. originating from a chat,
this packet will be used to ask all the players, if they support the accusation.

.. seealso::
   See the :cg:packet:`cg:game.dk.complaint` for further information on accusations.

Structure
---------

Note that all examples shown here contain placeholder data and will have different content in actual packets.

This is the data sent by the server to the client: ::

   {
      "type":"hochzeit_clarification_trick",
      "target":"296f8f9f-40dc-4ef7-b9b5-851d58c9c966",
   }

``type`` is the context in which the request is sent.

.. note::
   Following types are available: ``vornehalt``, ``solo``, ``schmeissen``, ``schweinchen``,
   ``superschweine``, ``hyperschweine``, ``armut``, ``armut_trump_choice``, ``armut_return_choice``,
   ``hochzeit``, ``hochzeit_clarification_trick`` and ``accusation_vote``\ .

``target`` is the :term:`UUID` of the player to whom the question is directed. This is
necessary for sometimes all players are supposed to hear a question, though it might not
be directed at all of them.
