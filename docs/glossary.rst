   Custom game
      A :term:`custom game` is a game that is created by a player and not by the
      :term:`matchmaking` system. After the creation, the game will be prepared in a
      :term:`lobby`\ . In a custom game, the game as well as the rules can be chosen
      individually. Furthermore, users can be manually added and removed as players and
      as spectators.

   Lobby
      A :term:`lobby` is a submenu used for the creation of :term:`custom game`\ . In it,
      settings for the game can be specified and other players can be invited to join the
      game.

   Matchmaking
      The :term:`matchmaking` system is an algorithm on the server conceived to matching
      multiple users that want to play, together, preferably users with the same level
      of experience.

   Party
      A :term:`party` is a group of players that joined to play together, either a
      :term:`custom game` or a game created by the :term:`matchmaking` system.
