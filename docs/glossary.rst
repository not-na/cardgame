   Custom game
      A :term:`custom game` is a game that is created by a player and not by the
      :term:`matchmaking` system. After the creation, the game will be prepared in a
      :term:`lobby`\ . In a custom game, the game as well as the rules can be chosen
      individually. Furthermore, users can be manually added and removed as players and
      as spectators.
